#====================================== Rule Pages ======================================#
### Here you are some examples, you can add all pages you want, just need to copy the same format and add more numbers, like "Page_4", "Page_5"... or also remove them.
### This plugin supports Bukkit colors ===>    http://dev.bukkit.org/media/images/42/45/Colors.png
# And other Bukkit Formats ===>    &n = Underlined   ||   &o = Italic   ||   &m = Strike-through   ||   &l = Bold   ||   &k = Magic   ||   &r = Reset Format
### Take care about special characters, bukkit works with SnakeParser, that usually give parsing errors with characters like, if it's your case, try coding the file to ANSI instead of UTF-8.
